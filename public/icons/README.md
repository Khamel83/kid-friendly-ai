# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the PWA:
- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

For development, these files can be generated using an online PWA icon generator or created manually.
The app will still work without these files, but the PWA installation experience will be improved when they are present.

## Temporary Solution
For testing purposes, you can use the favicon.ico as a fallback, or generate placeholder icons using online tools.
