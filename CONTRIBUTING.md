  className?: string;
}

export const YourComponent: React.FC<YourComponentProps> = ({
  title,
  onAction,
  className = ''
}) => {
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setIsActive(true);
    onAction?.();
  }, [onAction]);

  return (
    <div className={`your-component ${className} ${isActive ? 'active' : ''}`}>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        {isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive'}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 3. Testing Your Changes

  it('renders with title', () => {
    render(<YourComponent title="Test Title" />);
    expect(screen.getByText('Test Title')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('calls onAction when clicked', () => {
    const mockOnAction = jest.fn();
    render(<YourComponent title="Test" onAction={mockOnAction} />);

    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Inactive'));
    expect(mockOnAction).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```
